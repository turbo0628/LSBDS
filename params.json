{"name":"LSBDS","tagline":"Large Scale Biology Database Search on Xeon Phi platform","body":"LSBDS is developed for searching large-scale biological sequence databases with the Smith-Waterman algorithm on Xeon Phi-based neo-heterogenous architectures. In order to make full use of the compute power of both the multi-core CPU and the many-core Xeon Phi hardware, we use a collaborative computing scheme as well as hybrid parallelism. At the CPU side, we employ SSE intrinsics and multi-threading to implement SIMD parallelism. At the Xeon Phi side, we use Knights Corner vector instructions to gain more data parallelism. Evaluations on real protein sequence databases show that our method achieves a peak performance up to 220 GCUPS on a neo-heterogeneous platform consisting of two Intel E5-2620 CPUs and two Intel Xeon Phi 7110P cards. Our implementation also exhibits good scalability in terms of database size and query length.\r\n\r\n#Citation\r\n\r\nOur paper is still under submission\r\n\r\n##Related Papers\r\n\r\nXSW: Accelerating Biological Database Search on Xeon Phi\r\nLipeng Wang, Yuandong Chan, Xiaohui Duan, Haidong Lan, Xiangxu Meng, and Weiguo Liu.\r\nThe 28th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS 2014), Phoenix,USA, May, 2014.\r\n\r\nSWAPHI: Smith-Waterman protein database search on Xeon Phi coprocessors\r\nYongchao Liu and Bertil Schmidt. 25th IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP 2014), 2014, pp. 184-185.\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\n\r\nWe provide binaries compiled with ICC 15.0.0 on CENTOS 6.4.\r\n\r\nThe makeDB is an auxiliary program to carry out the database preprocessing operation.
